# bibites-save-reader
The program can extract everything from the save file. Just run the program choose a save file you want to extract data from, and click what data you want. The data is then placed in a folder called output. The output folder automatically created in the same folder as the program.

You can also copy bibites and eggs. Just click the button, choose a file to read from then the file you want to place the bibites/eggs in.

The program is made in python and compiled using auto-py-to-exe. It is only guaranteed to work on windows.

If you want any other feature in the program just tell me and I will update it.



How to copy bibites or eggs from a save file to another one:

1. Run the .exe and choose a save to copy from.

2. Click 'Copy bibites from one save to another' or 'Copy eggs from one save to another' depending on what you want to copy

3. Choose the save to copy from. Then the save to copy to.

4. Wait untill the text at the bottom says it is copied.

5. Open the save in The Bibites, there you will find the bibites/eggs you just copied. (It will display the wrong amount of bibites on the save, but that is fixed by saving normally.)
